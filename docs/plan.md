# Principal Engineer Thorough Review & Refactoring Plan

This document reviews your schema-driven migration codebase and provides a **refactoring roadmap** to align with best-practice, production-grade, and sustainable software engineering. 

---

## 1. 🔍 Thorough Code Review (Key Findings)

### a) **Models & Serialization**

- **Current:** You have generated dataclasses from schema. Many `to_dict` and `from_dict` methods are already explicit, but some legacy or hand-written models may not be, and the generator may not always produce the most robust code for all edge cases (especially for enums, optionals, nested lists, and forward references).
- **Risk:** If any model uses `asdict()` or `cls(**data)` for (de)serialization, there are bugs lurking—especially with enums and nested models.

### b) **Validation**

- **Current:** There is a validator (`config_validator.py`) that uses `jsonschema` to validate the JSON config pre-load.
- **Risk:** Not all entry points (e.g. direct file loads, command-line tools) may enforce validation before constructing model objects. Some code might pass dicts instead of dataclasses.

### c) **Templates & Application Logic**

- **Current:** Jinja2 templates receive a `context` which may still be a dict or a mixture of dict and dataclass objects.
- **Risk:** Loss of type safety and potential for `KeyError` or silent bugs in templates. Dict access in templates is a code smell.

### d) **Discovery & Builder Layer**

- **Current:** Discovery code (e.g. `discovery_queries.py`) sometimes builds lists of dicts, then attempts to convert to dataclasses.
- **Risk:** This is fragile and can drift from the schema; all builder code should return dataclass objects as soon as possible.

### e) **Defensive Programming & Automation**

- **Current:** Models are generated, but automation to enforce schema drift (e.g. in CI) is not evident; not all code is fully type hinted.
- **Risk:** Models can drift, bugs can creep in unnoticed, and future maintainers may break boundaries.

## 2. 🛠️ Refactor Plan (Explicit Steps)

### 1. **Model Codegen: Always Explicit, Always Idempotent**

- Ensure **every model** generated by `schema_to_dataclass.py` has explicit, field-by-field `to_dict` and `from_dict` methods (as in your latest generator, see below for the pattern).
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` at the top for forward references.
- Add a warning header:  
  ```python
  # THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED. DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY!
  # Edit enhanced_migration_schema.json and re-run codegen.
  ```

### 2. **Validation: Enforced at All Entrypoints**

- **Before** deserializing JSON into model objects anywhere, **always** validate with `jsonschema`. 
- Consider adding a `MigrationConfig.from_json_file(filename: str, validate: bool = True)` method that validates and then loads.

### 3. **Discovery/Builder: Only Dataclasses**

- Refactor any code that builds lists of dicts (e.g., `tables_config = []` with dicts) to instead build and return only dataclass objects.
- For example, in `TableDiscovery._analyze_table`, return a `TableConfig` instance, never a dict.

### 4. **Templates: Only Pass Typed Objects**

- The template context should be made up **entirely** of dataclass objects, not dicts.
- In `TemplateService`, ensure you always pass dataclasses to templates, and access in templates is always via attributes (e.g., `table.owner`), never keys.

### 5. **Round-trip and Type Safety Testing**

- Create a `tests/` directory. For each model, write a test:
  ```python
  def test_round_trip():
      obj = ModelClass.factory_with_all_fields()  # Factory populates all fields
      d = obj.to_dict()
      obj2 = ModelClass.from_dict(d)
      assert obj == obj2
  ```
- Add a test that loads a real config, validates it, and round-trips it.

### 6. **Automation & CI**

- Add a Makefile or script to regenerate models and run all tests.
- Add pre-commit or GitHub Actions CI that:
  - Validates all config files with the schema.
  - Fails if generated models are out of date (compare with committed `migration_models.py`).
  - Runs round-trip unit tests.

### 7. **Type Hints & Documentation**

- Ensure every class, method, and function has type hints and docstrings. This applies to both generated and hand-written code.

## 3. ⚡️ Example Refactored Model (Codegen Output)

```python name=lib/migration_models.py
# THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED FROM enhanced_migration_schema.json
# DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY! Edit the schema and regenerate.

from __future__ import annotations
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
from enum import Enum
import dataclasses

class YesNoEnum(Enum):
    YES = "YES"
    NO = "NO"

@dataclass
class ColumnInfo:
    name: str
    type: str
    nullable: YesNoEnum
    details: Optional[Details]
    history: List[HistoryItem]

    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        def convert(val):
            if isinstance(val, Enum):
                return val.value
            elif dataclasses.is_dataclass(val):
                return val.to_dict()
            elif isinstance(val, list):
                return [convert(x) for x in val]
            elif isinstance(val, dict):
                return {k: convert(v) for k, v in val.items()}
            else:
                return val
        return {f: convert(getattr(self, f)) for f in self.__dataclass_fields__}

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, data: dict) -> "ColumnInfo":
        if data is None:
            return None
        return cls(
            name=data.get("name"),
            type=data.get("type"),
            nullable=YesNoEnum(data["nullable"]) if "nullable" in data and data["nullable"] is not None else None,
            details=Details.from_dict(data["details"]) if "details" in data and data["details"] is not None else None,
            history=[HistoryItem.from_dict(x) for x in data.get("history", [])],
        )
```

## 4. 📝 Example: Template Context (Jinja2)

**Before:**
```python
context = {
    "owner": table["owner"],
    "current_state": table["current_state"],
    ...
}
```

**After:**  
```python
context = {
    "table": table,  # TableConfig dataclass
    "owner": table.owner,
    "current_state": table.current_state,
    ...
}
```
**In Jinja:**  
```jinja2
{{ table.owner }}  # Always attribute access!
{{ table.current_state.partition_type }}
```

---

## 5. 🗂️ Example: Validation at Entry

```python
from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError
from lib.migration_models import MigrationConfig

def load_config(filename: str) -> MigrationConfig:
    with open(filename) as f:
        raw = json.load(f)
    validate(instance=raw, schema=your_loaded_schema)
    return MigrationConfig.from_dict(raw)
```

---

## 6. 🛠️ Example: Enforced CI

- Add a `Makefile`:
  ```makefile
  models:
      python tools/schema_to_dataclass.py

  test:
      pytest tests/

  check: models test
  ```
- In CI:
  - Run `make check`
  - Compare committed `migration_models.py` with generated version and fail if mismatched.

## 8. 🚀 Next Steps

- Regenerate all models with explicit methods.
- Refactor all builder/discovery code to use dataclasses only.
- Ensure templates and main business logic never use dicts, only typed objects.
- Add schema validation at every config load boundary.
- Write round-trip and schema-conformance tests.
- Lock down codegen and automate checks in CI.
