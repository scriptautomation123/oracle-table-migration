# Demo: Final Migration Test Workflow
# ===================================
# Shows how the complete migration validation works

echo "🚀 Final Migration Test Demo"
echo "==========================="
echo ""

echo "📋 What this test validates:"
echo "  ✅ master1.sql contains EVERYTHING needed for complete migration"
echo "  ✅ No manual intervention required"
echo "  ✅ All constraints, indexes, and data preserved"
echo "  ✅ Complete end-to-end validation"
echo ""

echo "📁 Available test options:"
./scripts/final-migration-test.sh --help | head -25

echo ""
echo "🔍 Test workflow:"
echo "  1. Creates comprehensive test schema with constraints & indexes"
echo "  2. Generates migration scripts using your configuration"
echo "  3. Executes ONLY master1.sql for each table"
echo "  4. Validates complete migration success"
echo "  5. Reports any gaps in master1.sql functionality"
echo ""

echo "💡 Key validation points:"
echo "  • Data migration completeness (row counts match)"
echo "  • Constraint preservation (PK, FK, UK, CK all enabled)"
echo "  • Index recreation (simple, composite, function-based)"
echo "  • Partitioning implementation (correct type and key)"
echo "  • Referential integrity (FK relationships work)"
echo "  • Performance validation (partition pruning works)"
echo ""

echo "🎯 Success criteria:"
echo "  ✅ master1.sql runs without errors"
echo "  ✅ All data migrated and validated"  
echo "  ✅ All constraints re-enabled and validated"
echo "  ✅ All indexes recreated with proper locality"
echo "  ✅ Zero manual intervention required"
echo ""

echo "❌ If test fails:"
echo "  • Review generated master1.sql template"
echo "  • Enhance template to include missing steps"
echo "  • Update generation logic in generate_scripts.py"
echo "  • Re-run test until master1.sql is complete"
echo ""

echo "🏃 To run the actual test:"
echo ""
echo "  # First, set up Oracle connection:"
echo "  sqlcl /nolog"
echo "  conn username/password@//host:port/service"
echo "  save connection my_oracle_db"
echo "  exit"
echo ""
echo "  # Then run the final test:"
echo "  ./scripts/final-migration-test.sh --connection my_oracle_db"
echo ""
echo "  # For verbose output with detailed validation:"
echo "  ./scripts/final-migration-test.sh --connection my_oracle_db --verbose"
echo ""

echo "📊 Test output files:"
echo "  • final_migration_test_TIMESTAMP.log - Detailed execution log"
echo "  • test_results_TIMESTAMP.json - Structured test results"
echo "  • final_test_results.json - CI/CD compatible results"
echo ""

echo "✨ This is the ultimate validation that your migration system"
echo "   generates complete, production-ready master1.sql scripts!"
